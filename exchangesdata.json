		"description": "\"Introducing Escodex- a decentralized exchange platform that allows trade on popular bitcoin and altcoin pairs without a single point of failure.  It is based on an escrow concept. It allows anonymous global traders to swap their digital assets on escrow platform without apprehensions like \"\"Who would transfer first?\"\" thus ensuring 100% safe and secure transfer.\r\n\r\nEscoDex is backed by a talented group of software developers and their passion for technology, distributed systems and economy that brought them to the crypto ecosystem.\r\n\r\nDecentralization is the key driving force in the crypto-economy.  EscoDex is a decentralized exchange (DEX) that will support trading services for multiple cryptocurrencies in upcoming days, aiming to create a service that is simple and easy for the everyday user. EscoDex provides blockchain wallet service where consumers and traders can transact with multiple digital assets.\r\n\r\nFeatures of EscoDex\r\nDecentralized – there is no single point of failure. The system is peer-to-peer and trading can not be stopped or censored.\r\n\r\nSecure Funds - Your money will stay in your wallets. No involvement of third party now, so no need to trust your money with something where hackers can get to.\r\n\r\nAdvantage of Escodex:\r\n\r\n1. Usability- Anybody can access its DEX via Escodex Client which acts as both a DEX and a cryptocurrency wallet.\r\n2. Autonomy- User gets full control of their funds\r\n3. DEX advantage- Escodex doesn’t have a single point of failure like centralized server hostings or databases that are prone to hacks.\r\n4. Asset advantage- Escodex satisfies the basic criteria of using a decentralized asset as it makes less sense to use a decentralized asset in a centralized environment which can be taken down anytime\"",

CredoEx runs on the highly scalable and reliable Elixir programming language used to build most of the internet’s networking infrastructure and massive applications like Whatsapp.\r\n\r\nCredoEx also brought in world class, easy-to-use design to ensure both experienced and novice users could make the most of the exchange. CredoEx lists tokens that allows users to access powerful services in the crypto-economy like identity management, decentralized computing, and prediction markets, to act as a gateway to the token economy.\r\n\r\nCredoEx has large ambitions—to become the premier exchange for cryptocurrencies and to be the foundation for the token economy by listing useful new token projects and helping to accelerate these projects with paid marketing email campaigns on BitBounce.",
